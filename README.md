# ðŸ¥¾ DropServe: Files On The Corner

Ainâ€™t no cloud, ainâ€™t no waitingâ€”DropServe turns any folder into a block party for your files.  
Whatever you or your AI cook up, DropServe gives you a dead-simple download linkâ€”no questions asked, no browser drama.

- **Always force-downloads.** Text, zips, logs, you name itâ€”every file drops like a mixtape in 2003.
- **Bulletproof Docker build.** No Alpine headaches, just works.
- **Plug and play with Open WebUI, your homelab, or anything with files to share.**

*Built with NYC hustle, tested by the streets, approved by Timbs.*
